# PokeQuiz
**Project Name:** PokeQuiz

**Public Database:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/guavocado/pokemon-stats-1025-pokemons/data _(Only one database was needed, and used, due to the scope of the project and only being one person working on it.)_

**Description:** PokeQuiz is an application that lets someone make a profile, set their favorite pokemon, create notes on them, submit feedback and test their knowledge on pokemon different pokemone triva based upon the stats. Then see their rankings upon other users. Along with that, users are able to look up profiles and different pokemon information that could help them on their way, like different egg groups. 

**Goal of Project:** The goal of the project is to create a Pokémon Quiz based application that allowed users to take quizzes and test their knowledge on Pokemon. I have alot of friends who enjoy the game competitively and have always wanted to be able to test that skill. This application was created with that in mind. Users of the application can also make comments on different Pokemon. They can be tips or just something someone likes about that Pokemon. 

**Interactions the Application Provides:**
- Seven Quizzes that test the user's knowledge on Pokemon. From asking the basic stats of a single Pokemon, to comparing the stats of two different Pokemon. 
- Profiles that can be edited to contain a bio, and their favorite Pokemon.
- Eight game based leader-boards where the users can compare their scores, as each quiz gives a different amount, against other users. There is one massive leader-board that contains every single quiz score. 
- Leader-board of the most liked Pokemon. Allowing users to see which Pokemon that is liked the most. 
- The ability to send feedback about the application. 
- The ability to create and remove notes on Pokemon, in which anyone can search up to see. As well as being able to quickly see your own notes that you have made. 
- The ability to search up Pokemon, allowing the user to study and read up on the Pokemon knowledge
